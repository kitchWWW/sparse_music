Performing Forces: Slow Music is for a soloist and accompaniment of a different or multiple timbres. Both accompanying parts may be played in any octave and may be doubled in any octave. Those playing the accompanying part may play single sustained notes as written, roll (in the case of Marimba, etc.), or play two to a part to cover breathing (saxophones, brass, etc.).Performing Notes: To be played without any sense of meter. Note groups that are within one bar can be played whenever the soloist determines to be most expressive. Note groups that span multiple bars should be coordinated with the ensemble to make the transition happen at the correct moment.A new score should be generated for EVERY performance from www.brianellissound.com/
